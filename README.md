# Run Pimecore on Kubernetes

A Helm chart to deploy Pimecore on Kubernetes

Go to the [Helm Chart README](chart/pimcore/) to see how to use it.

## Motivation

We plan to use [Pimecore](https://pimcore.com) for product information management. Since we run everything on Kubernetes (Azure AKS), we want to run Pimcore on Kubernetes as well.

We have not found any recent Helm chart for Pimcore, so we decided to create our own. This is a work in progress and we are happy to accept contributions.

It is an adaption of the original [installation procedure for Docker](https://docs.pimcore.com/platform/next/Pimcore/Getting_Started/Installation/Docker_Based_Installation).
